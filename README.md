# Sample Secure Password Generator
This is a sample password generator that simulates a user/employee interaction with a webpage API to obtain a random password everytime based on the user's input for length and whether or not specific character sets are to be included.

## Installation
Clone this repository to access the .html, .css and .js files. With files saved within the same folder, .html can be run on browser to test functionality and appearance.

Live sample of the working prototype is hosted at:

## Usage
This code would best be used within a company intranet as a tool at the disposal of users/employees required to generate basic secure passwords of varying lengths.

Additional special character symbols can be appended to the current code as some symbols were omitted to avoid common syntax errors within the code.
